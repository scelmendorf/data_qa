---

Inspired by common errors I have found in my own (and others) data, this website contains 10 simple rules for checking your own data. It is aimed at common problems found in tabular data, how to find them and how to fix them!

This is a work in progress!

1.  Strings mixed with numbers and dates

2.  Missing data

3.  Duplicate data

4.  Data in range

5.  Spelling (unfortunately) counts

6.  Geocoordinates

7.  Time zones

8.  Logic checks

9.  Data vis for quality control - generic

10. Data vis for quality control - customized
