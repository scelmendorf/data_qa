For example, were data collected every year? If so examining the years included in the dataset may be important.\nSometimes a visual check is easy to spot what is missing\n\nsort (unique (df$year))\n\n [1] 1978 1979 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993\n[16] 1994 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010\n[31] 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2020 2021 2022\n\n\nSometimes it’s hard to find exactly what is missing! setdiff (for simple checks for expected values based on complete sets) expand.grid (for checking pre-defined combinations) and the padr (for padding out dataset based on regular temporal frequency) are your friends here. As an example, I can use the simple code below to figure out what years are missing. It is then up to you whether it is important to add those years with NA values, or just carry on knowing they are missing.\n\nsetdiff(seq(min(df$year), max(df$year)), unique(df$year))\n\n[1] 1980 1995 2003 2011 2019\n\n\nCommonly, we expect a similar number of samples over some interval (e.g. per site or year)\n\nct_by_year = df %>%\n  group_by(year) %>%\n  tally()\n\nViewing just the first 10 years, sampling appears very uneven, is this expected?\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nn\n\n\n\n\n1978\n26\n\n\n1979\n36\n\n\n1981\n53\n\n\n1982\n64\n\n\n1983\n69\n\n\n1984\n64\n\n\n1985\n64\n\n\n1986\n57\n\n\n1987\n64\n\n\n1988\n49"
