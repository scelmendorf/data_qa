## Motivation

We all try to be as careful as possible when taking measurements in the field, entering data, calibrating instruments, but humans -- and machines -- make mistakes. Quality science relies on identifying these errors *before analyzing data* so that they can be corrected, removed, or addressed analytically. Statistical analysis is a required component of graduate education, but we are usually left to our own devices to figure out the all important data qc step that should precede any data analysis. This workshop is inspired by the most common errors I tend to find in my own (and others') data. The structure is an interactive (or online) workshop using R to detect and correct common problems in tabular datasets. You will need a laptop with R/RStudio installed to get the most out of the session.
